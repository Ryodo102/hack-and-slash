# Game Ideas

 - Galaga-type cookie clicker - You shoot things, but you also buy fighters/military to assist in your fight against things
 - I don't know.  Something about tetris and meals
 - Game Mod Simulator - This sounds like that game dev game except with mods
 - Something about a lawnmower and redbull

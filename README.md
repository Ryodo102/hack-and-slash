# Game Ideas

 - Galaga-type cookie clicker - You shoot things, but you also buy fighters/military to assist in your fight against things, +1 jvg
 - I don't know.  Something about tetris and meals +.75, jrhii
 - Game Mod Simulator - This sounds like that game dev game except with mods -1, jrhii
 - Handyman: sandboxy game a-la job simulator or something.  You're in a house or garage or w.e. and and yank stuff out of one thing and throw it in another and see what happens.  redbull into a gas tank, motor on a bike, w.e.  Something funny should happen with this mashups, maybe usually unexpected and bad. +.5, jrhii
 - Mod Tower: You build levels on a skyscraper, competing against an enemy.  You can attack them, defend yourself, research etc.  Goal of the game is to destroy the opponents tower or reach the moon. +1, jrhii, +1 jvg
 - Caveman Evolution: Start with a stick and fight waves of enemies.  Find things to mod your stick to do cooler things like do AOE damage, eventually shoot projectiles, etc. etc.  The mods always add to your character, are infinitely scaling, and never interfere with each other, but possibly combo with each other.   +.75, jrhii, +1 jvg
 - Some sort of tower defense game - Bitches love tower defense games.
 - Hack & Slash.  You're a hacker who is transported to inside his computer where he has to use a slash symbol as a sword to fight off the virus he was working on and escape back to reality.

## Digging Deeper

### Caveman Evolution

Description: Platformer where you are a character with nothing more than a stick (maybe bone) for which to fight off hordes of enemies.  Throughout the game enemies will drop upgrades that will modify your attack and make you more effective at killing increasingly difficult hoardes.

#### Cons

 - Will have to make hoard AI that can deal with platforms and is also challenging
 - Will have to make a variety of infinitely scaling enemies with different types of attacks to keep up with the player
 - Will have to program logic for each upgrade
 - Will have to do the basic platformer code (gravity, basic physics (projectile blocking), etc.)

#### Pros

  - Fun, probably

### Hack! The Tower Defense Game

Description: Basic tower defense game with basic towers.

#### Pros

 - Hoard AI will be very easy to do => Move towards exit along path.  If there's path blocking, A* is very easy to implement.
 - Towers AI should be easy as well.  If enemy in range, attack.
 - Graphics should be relatively easy to do.  The towers could shoot letters & symbols out to kill the viruses/hacking attempts
 - Bitches love Tower defense games

#### Cons
 - Will have to make variety of towers
 - Will have to make variety of enemies
 - Might have to deal with upgrades?

### Hack & Slash

Description: I'm guessing this is top down, dungeon crawler-type game.

#### Pros

 - Easy to do graphics
 - Top down physics is easier than platformer
 -

#### Cons

 - AI might be slightly more difficult?
 - Will probably have to come up with an actual story
 - Will have to make unique enemies.
 - Will have to find good way to keep player engaged

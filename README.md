 - I don't know.  Something about tetris and meals +.75, jrhii
 - Game Mod Simulator - This sounds like that game dev game except with mods -1, jrhii
 - Handyman: sandboxy game a-la job simulator or something.  You're in a house or garage or w.e. and and yank stuff out of one thing and throw it in another and see what happens.  redbull into a gas tank, motor on a bike, w.e.  Something funny should happen with this mashups, maybe usually unexpected and bad. +.5, jrhii
 - Mod Tower: You build levels on a skyscraper, competing against an enemy.  You can attack them, defend yourself, research etc.  Goal of the game is to destroy the opponents tower or reach the moon. +1, jrhii, +1 jvg
 - Caveman Evolution: Start with a stick and fight waves of enemies.  Find things to mod your stick to do cooler things like do AOE damage, eventually shoot projectiles, etc. etc.  The mods always add to your character, are infinitely scaling, and never interfere with each other, but possibly combo with each other.   +.75, jrhii, +1 jvg
 - Some sort of tower defense game - Bitches love tower defense games. 
 - Hack & Slash.  You're a hacker who is transported to inside his computer where he has to use a slash symbol as a sword to fight off the virus he was working on and escape back to reality.

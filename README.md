# Game Ideas

 - Galaga-type cookie clicker - You shoot things, but you also buy fighters/military to assist in your fight against things
 - I don't know.  Something about tetris and meals
 - Game Mod Simulator - This sounds like that game dev game except with mods
 - Handyman: sandboxy game a-la job simulator or something.  You're in a house or garage or w.e. and and yank stuff out of one thing and throw it in another and see what happens.  redbull into a gas tank, motor on a bike, w.e.  Something funny should happen with this mashups, maybe usually unexpected and bad.
 - Mod Tower: You build levels on a skyscraper, competing against an enemy.  You can attack them, defend yourself, research etc.  Goal of the game is to destroy the opponents tower or reach the moon. +1, jhrii
